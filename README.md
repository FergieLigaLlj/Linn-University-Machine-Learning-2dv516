### Attribution of different jupyter notebooks to the corresponding assignments and their learning expectation:

Exercise 1:
k-NN Classification: data visualization, k-NN prediction, decision boundary plot (from scratch) and training error calculation.

Exercise 2:
k-NN Regression: random dataset division, data visualization, k-NN regression result and MSE training error for varying k, corresponding MSE test error, k optimization.

Exercise 4:
k-NN Classification using scikit-learn: repeating Exercise 1 with scikit-learn.
