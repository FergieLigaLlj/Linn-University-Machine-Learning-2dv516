### Attribution of different jupyter notebooks to the corresponding assignments and their learning expectation:

Exercise 1: Clustering:
**kmeans.py** is the class for implementing **k-means** algorithm by scratch, **bkmeans** function is implemented by the **bisecting k-means** algorithm with **kmeans.py**, **output** the clustering class

Exercise 2: Visualization of Results:
**Data Visualization** with **chosen real-world dataset** from websites and implemented by **kmeans, bkmeans and hierarchical clustering**.

2.1. Comparison of DR Techniques: **PCA, MDS, and t-SNE**
Apply DR techniques for each dataset and evaluate **performance** and **class separation**

3.2. Comparison of Clustering Techniques: **Bisecting k-Means** with **classic k-Means** and **hierarchical clustering** (one chosen DR technique)
**clustering technique peformance** and **clustering separation** effect again
